# How to understand files in the repo
Python files: Each python file is pretty self explanatory.  Most python files except the neural_network.py produces JSON output.
JSON files: Result of successful completion of each python file being run.  I was only able to upload JSON files below 25MB in size.  If curious on some of the larger JSON files please contact unclesam@umich.edu
PNG files: Screenshot proof of running neural network algorithms on various hyper parameter combinataions.  Screenshots show final prediction accuracy as well as epoch iterations.
